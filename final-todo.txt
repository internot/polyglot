TODO 1:

Make the claims of generality more precise. 
(our high-level presentation of polyglots and their abuse possibilities as general, and the
focus on new PDF-based attacks as particular)

TODO 2:

Clarify the general vs. particular aspects of mitigation.

TODO 3:

Discussion of most promising directions. 
(when content is loaded in a specific context the browser already
knows what type it expects and sends the expected type along with the request)

TODO 4:

Make the treatment of the related work more coherent.

TODO 5:

Update the visualization with a more professional appearance.

TODO 6:

Move the listings to their appropriate positions.

TODO 7:

Generally clarify the exposition where appropriate.
(Go over Section 2 again)

TODO 8?:

Evaluation of mobile browsers would indeed make an interesting addition, and certainly one
we would like to delve into further.







"will activate the malicious polyglot".  This isn't clear; what does it mean to activate a polyglot?  Given specific names might be one way to solve the problem. In a sense, you have program M that is malicious wrapped in program N that is not.  It seems like the vulnerable website seems N||M, and interprets this as type N, while the victim sees M, the malware.

# To Andrei: Not corrected yet, thinking about it.

The evaluation for this paper felt somewhat pro forma. I would have rather seen a more extensive 
set of tests against the individual browsers, 
and perhaps to have considered mobile web browsers 
as well.
